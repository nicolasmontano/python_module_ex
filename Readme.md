# Coverage

Coverage is a measure of how much of your code is tested. It is a percentage of the code that is executed when the tests are run. The higher the coverage, the more of your code is tested. The goal is to have 100\% coverage, but this is not always possible. The coverage report is generated by the coverage tool, which is a Python package that can be installed using pip. The coverage tool can be run from the command line, and it will generate a report that shows which lines of code are executed when the tests are run. The coverage report can be used to identify areas of the code that are not tested, and to improve the test coverage of the code.

## Installation

```bash
pip install coverage
```

```code execution
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report -m
coverage html ( creates a htmlcov folder with the coverage report)
```
